## Hi there, I'm Will 

![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oc7vgwo7tcb7juepgzcg.jpg)

I'm a Lead Software Engineer for the [Mantel Group](https://mantelgroup.com.au/), and a [Microsoft Azure MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/mvp/profile/19af723e-b1eb-4e25-acd5-55d145226ef3) focusing on Azure Kubernetes and Open Source technologies.

I'm passionate about all things Cloud Native, including containers, Kubernetes, and Azure. I'm passionate about building sustainable developer platforms, and teaching others how to do so. I speak at a variety of technical conferences and meetups around the world, and I produce videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@willvelida) where I teach others how to build sustainable cloud-native applications.

If you want to see what I'm building, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/willvelida). If you want to chat, feel free to reach out on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/willvelida.com).

Happy coding! ü§ìüñ•Ô∏è
