## Hi there, I'm Will 

![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oc7vgwo7tcb7juepgzcg.jpg)

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft, working in the [Industry Solutions Engineering](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/ISE/) team based out of Melbourne, Australia. In the past I've worked in the Fast Track for Azure team in Azure CXP, and I've worked as a Software Engineer in the banking, agricultural, health insurance, and retail industries.

I'm passionate about all things Cloud Native, including containers, Kubernetes, and Azure. I'm passionate about building sustainable developer platforms, and teaching others how to do so. I speak at a variety of technical conferences and meetups around the world, such as Microsoft Ignite, NDC Sydney, Techorama, and more! I also produce videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@willvelida) where I teach others how to build sustainable cloud-native applications.

If you want to see what I'm building, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/willvelida). If you want to chat, feel free to reach out on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/willvelida.com).

Happy coding! ü§ìüñ•Ô∏è
