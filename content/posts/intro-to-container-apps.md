[Azure Container Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/) is a serverless container platform that we can use to run microservices and containerized applications without having to worry about managing complex infrastructure and container orchestrations.

In this video, I introduce the key concepts and features of Azure Container Apps and go through a demo on how you can create a simple Container App using Bicep.
