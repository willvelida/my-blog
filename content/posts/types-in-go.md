So the Golang learning adventure continues! We have our [developer environment](https://www.willvelida.com/posts/setting-up-dev-environment-golang/) setup so we're ready to dive into more Golang code.

In this post, I'll be talking about types and variables in Go. If you've used other languages, you may notice as we go through this that Go has some differences in how it uses types compared to other languages. In this article, we'll be covering:

- What types are available to us?
- Assigning values in Go
- Constants in Go
- How to name variables and constants

## What types are available to us?

Go has many built-in types that we would find in other languages. These are:

- Booleans (true or false values)
- Integers (numbers like 1, 2, 3)
- Floats (like 1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
- Strings (like "Hello!")

Of course there's a bit more detail to cover here. Starting with number types, Go has support for 12 different types of numerics that can be grouped into three categories. Go provides support for the following integer types:

| Type | Range of Values |
| ---- | --------------- |
| int8 | -128 to 127 |
| int16 | –32768 to 32767 |
| int32 | –2147483648 to 2147483647 |
| int64 | –9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 |
| uint8 | 0 to 255 |
| uint16 | 0 to 65536 |
| uint32 | 0 to 4294967295 |
| uint64 | 0 to 18446744073709551615 |

The zero value (or default value) for all integer types is 0.
