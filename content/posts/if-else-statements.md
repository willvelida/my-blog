In Go, we can use conditional statements to execute code based on different conditions. We can also use ```if```, ```else if``` and ```if else``` statements to execute code provided if a condition is true or false. If/else statements are commonplace in programming, so if you're already a seasoned programmer you won't spend long here. But as always, we'll take our time and make sure we understand fully what's going on.

In this article we'll cover:

- The ```if``` statement
- The ```if else``` statement
- The ```else if``` statement
- Conditional statements
- ```if``` statements inside ```if``` statements (Ifception).

## The If Statement

## The If Else Statement

## The Else If Statement

## Conditional Statements

## Ifception (Ifs inside Ifs)

## Conclusion

In this article, we talked about how we can use if statements and conditionals to control what code gets executed based on certain conditions in Go.

And no, I didn't just write this article to make a crappy pun on Inception. I've never watched the film. Learning control flow and conditional statements are an important milestone in any programming language, so well done you for taking the time to learn how it works in Go!

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on twitter [@willvelida](https://twitter.com/willvelida) and I'll try and help out the best I can.

In my next post, we'll start building Go programs using If, if/else and else/if statements.

Until next time, Happy coding! ü§ìüñ•Ô∏è
