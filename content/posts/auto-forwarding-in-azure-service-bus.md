Azure Service Bus has a **autoforwarding** feature that allows you to chain queues and topics to other queues and topics within the same Service Bus namespace. Using autofowarding, Service Bus removes messages from one topic or subscription (the source) and puts them on another queue or topic (destination).

In this post, I'll cover some scenarios where autoforwarding is useful, then I'll show you how you can enable autoforwarding on your Service Bus namespace and demonstrate how this works using Azure Functions.
